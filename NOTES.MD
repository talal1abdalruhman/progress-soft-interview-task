- Describe in your own words what is z-score and Min-Max scaling and why would we need to use such normalization methods? describe by example, if possible.
```
Both of them are technique to re-scale features values that have different scales.
 When you apply z-score technique, the features are scaled in such a way that they end 
 up having properties of a standard normal distribution with mean equal to zero and 
 standard deviation of one.
 on the other hand when you apply the data is scaled in such a way that the values 
 usually range between 0 â€“ 1.
 So that will help to prevent high values from controlling low values.

- We used Junit5 in our test cases, describe in your own words why would we use such library? 
what is unit testing and why would we use it?

- Did this task enrich technical skills or knowledge? If yes, tell us how: 
```
Yes, it was a great experience, and I learned a lot from it, like handling error
and thinking about complexity of the code, I've recovered my information and enhanced 
my knowledge.
Thanks for it.
